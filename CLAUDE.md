# CLAUDE.md

> [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) format — context for AI coding agents.

## Project overview

`monday-cli` is a TypeScript CLI for Monday.com's GraphQL API.
**Primary audience is AI coding agents** (Claude Code, Codex, etc.);
humans are second-class. Built incrementally via Claude Code on top of
`@mondaydotcomorg/api` (pinned to 14.0.0; Monday API pinned `2026-01`).

## Current state

- **Published:** `monday-cli@0.6.0` on npm (`latest` dist-tag,
  2026-05-18T16:30:21Z). **v0.6.0 published — release complete.**
  Release-prep closed at `98185d4..51ba1a4` (5 commits: ToC audit
  + slip / README refresh / version bump + audit-fix / CHANGELOG /
  close-docs sweep; envelope-snapshot probe ran clean + folded
  into close-docs prose per the v0.5 precedent). Annotated
  `v0.6.0` tag pushed pointing at `51ba1a4`; GitHub release live
  at https://github.com/Firer/monday-cli/releases/tag/v0.6.0.
  Previous: `monday-cli@0.5.0` (2026-05-17T20:55:05Z).
- **package.json version:** `0.6.0`.
- **Live numbers:** 4124 tests + 1 skipped across 172 files (was
  4115 + 1 at v0.7-M43 pre-flight baseline; +9 from the v0.7-M43
  IMPL test surface flip — 12 IMPL tests replacing 3 pre-flight
  stub assertions, covering the two-leg happy path top-level +
  subitem, D6 mixed-set asymmetry, dry-run two-`planned_changes`,
  D1 orphan-warn envelope, leg-1 failure w/ + w/o F4 remap,
  translation reject, atomicity-before-wire ENOENT, regression-
  guards across all 4 emit surfaces); coverage 98.79 / 95.65 /
  99.16 / 99.08 (stmts / branches / fns / lines) at the
  95 / 95.45 / 95 / 95 floor (branches margin **0.20pp** — v0.7-
  M43 IMPL absorbed the 0.17pp drop across the new helper's leg-1
  / leg-2 catch arms; defensive non-CliError re-throws + the
  cause-details / metaSource unreachable arms c8-ignored per
  testing.md preferred form; the two preflight-warnings catch
  arms collapse the `&& length > 0` guard for a smaller branch
  surface than the JSON path's pattern at `create.ts:1010-1022`;
  was 0.37pp at v0.7-M43 pre-flight baseline — pre-flight stub
  body was c8-ignored so no branches absorption fired then; full
  breakdown in `docs/v0.7-plan.md` §3 M43 "Coverage residual");
  **29 ERROR_CODES**; **117 commands**; `npm audit` 1 moderate
  (`brace-expansion 5.0.2 → 5.0.5`; not a merge blocker per
  security.md "high = merge blocker"; defer to v0.7 release-
  prep audit-fix or earlier if a Codex round flags it).
- **Next session:** v0.7-M39 **pre-flight** (API pin bump
  `2026-01` → `2026-04` + mass-flip of `2026-01` literals across
  docs/probes/cassettes + envelope-snapshot refresh; per kickoff
  ship order M42 → M43 → re-probe SDK 15.x → **M39** → M40 → M41).
  At M43 close-docs (this commit) the SDK 15.x re-probe ran:
  `npm view @mondaydotcomorg/api versions --json` returns latest
  `14.0.0` — **SDK 15.x is NOT YET published**. M39 D1 fallback
  enumeration carries forward to M39 pre-flight:
  (a) SDK 15.x lift — STILL BLOCKED (re-probe at M39 kickoff);
  (b) string-literal override on SDK 14.0.0 + hand-rolled zod
  schemas per the "Boundary-typing trap" pattern — viable
  (override cost-scrutiny from v0.7 kickoff candidate-selection
  surfaced this as cheaper than initially framed: per-request
  `API-Version` header at `src/api/transport.ts:99` is already
  parameterised + overridable, hand-rolled zod schemas routine
  per the `.claude/rules/monday-api.md` "Boundary-typing trap");
  (c) continued wait + sequence-shuffle to ship more milestones
  first — applied at v0.7 kickoff (M42 + M43 first, M39 third);
  no more independent milestones remain to shuffle to. M39
  pre-flight session decides between (b) string-literal override
  and (c) one more wait cycle.

- **M43 SHIPPED at `5cf4365..c217011`** (R0 IMPL + R1-R3 Codex
  IMPL fix-up commits + R4 CONVERGED with zero findings). The
  v0.6-M38 → v0.7-M43 D6 fold lands the create-time file `--set`
  two-leg dispatch under the §5.8 orphan-warn atomicity envelope.
  Pre-flight contract diff cluster at `28f117c..ea71b55` (R0 + 5
  Codex pre-flight rounds, CONVERGED at R5); IMPL cluster at
  `5cf4365..c217011` (R0 + 4 Codex IMPL rounds, CONVERGED at R4).
  Behavioural findings: 0 P1 across all 9 rounds (pre-flight 5
  + IMPL 4); only W9 prose-drift fix-ups iterated to convergence.
  The R-v0.7-NEW-4 inherited contract-term checklist (graduated
  v0.7-M42 IMPL R7) short-circuited M43 IMPL's W9 cycle from
  M42's 8 rounds down to 4 — graduation earned its keep.

  D1-D3 closures + implementation summary:
  - **D1 — Atomicity envelope: (b) orphan-warn.** Leg-2 failure
    surfaces `internal_error` with `details.reason:
    'create_then_file_upload_partial_failure'` +
    `details.created_item_id` echoing leg-1's orphan +
    `details.column_id` + `details.cause` (M31 wire failure
    surface, JSON projection) + `details.hint` directing agents
    to retry leg-2 only (`monday item set <iid> <file-col>=<path>`)
    OR rollback (`monday item delete <iid> --yes`). Closure
    rationale: pre-flight rollback-viability probe could not run
    empirically (token lacked `create_item` permission on a
    token-created sandbox workspace + existing-board attempts
    correctly blocked by harness modify-shared-state guards).
    Defaulting to (b) preserves the agent's recovery handle
    without introducing a destructive `delete_item` cleanup leg
    whose own failure mode is unaccounted for. Future milestone
    can lift to (a) automatic rollback if a user-authorized
    probe sandbox surfaces concrete rollback-reliability data.
  - **D2 — Dry-run envelope:** two `planned_changes` entries
    (`operation: 'create_item'` / `'create_subitem'` with
    bundled non-file `column_values`, then `operation:
    'add_file_to_column'` with file pre-check echo; no
    `item_id` on entry-2 — the item doesn't exist at dry-run
    time).
  - **D3 — ERROR_CODES delta:** zero net change. Registry stays
    at 29. Atomicity failures route through existing
    `internal_error` with the new
    `create_then_file_upload_partial_failure` `details.reason`
    discriminator (M43 added the 5th supporting instance of
    R-v0.6-NEW-2's discriminator pattern, hitting the 5-consumer
    graduation threshold).

  R-class outcomes at M43 IMPL:
  - **R-v0.6-NEW-1** (file pre-check + Blob helper) graduated
    at the 5-consumer threshold (M42 4th + M43 5th confirmed
    `5cf4365`). Helper scaled cleanly to consumer-5 with zero
    internal-shape changes.
  - **R-v0.7-NEW-5** (fail-fast error-decoration block lift)
    INLINE at M43 IMPL — M43's leg-2 catch is structurally
    distinct from the fail-fast bulk pattern (always-`internal_
    error` outer code + `details.cause` JSON projection vs
    preserve-remapped-code with typed re-throw). Lift stays
    deferred at 2 consumers; cited as the 1st "considered but
    not tipped" event under R-NEW-58's consumer-threshold gating.
  - **R-NEW-76** (parseArgv-BEFORE-c8) graduated from "stub-
    anchored ordering invariant" to "wire-dispatch-anchored
    ordering invariant" — post-IMPL the c8 boundary is gone but
    the ordering itself stays load-bearing (argv-level failures
    surface as `usage_error` not `internal_error`).
  - **R-v0.7-NEW-4** (pre-IMPL contract-term checklist) extended
    with a "round-agnostic framing" sub-rule (M43 R3 surfaced
    round-counter staleness as a new W9 sub-category; close-docs
    landed the workflow.md extension request).

  Full M43 narrative + post-mortem + R-class log update at
  `docs/v0.7-plan.md` §3 M43 entry + §22 R-class register.

- **M42 SHIPPED** at `22df2fa..08ae263` (R0 IMPL + 8 Codex
  fix-up rounds: R1 behavioral; R2-R8 W9 prose sweep —
  asymptotic convergence with the R7 workflow.md graduation
  of "Pre-IMPL contract-term checklist for cross-doc grep"
  intended to short-circuit the pattern at v0.7-M43 onwards
  — M43 IMPL validated this at R4 convergence).

  Full v0.7 scope (M39-M43) unchanged from SKELETON. v0.8
  SKELETON stays unratified (opens after v0.7.0 publishes).
  Other carry-forward backlog (multi-level subitems /
  cross-board move value-overrides / resumable cross-board
  cursor / profile-scoped argument defaults / multi-file
  `--set` / stdin file-`--set`) stays deferred.

For every shipped milestone's narrative, post-mortem, Codex round
detail, and R-class refactor backlog, **read the plan docs** —
**do not duplicate that history here**:

1. **[`docs/cli-design.md`](./docs/cli-design.md)** — canonical
   contract: command surface, output envelope, 29 stable error codes,
   deferral list (§13), every binding decision.
2. **[`docs/v0.8-plan.md`](./docs/v0.8-plan.md)** — **SKELETON**
   (filed forward 2026-05-18). v0.8 = Monday API 2026-07 pin +
   user-entity migration (M44) + `user activity` (M45). Ratified
   at v0.8 kickoff candidate-selection AFTER v0.7.0 ships.
3. **[`docs/v0.7-plan.md`](./docs/v0.7-plan.md)** — **SKELETON**
   (filed forward 2026-05-18). v0.7 = Monday API 2026-04 pin +
   item set-description (M40) + doc block-create-bulk (M41) +
   v0.6.x bulk + create file `--set` carve-outs (M42 / M43).
   Ratified at v0.7 kickoff candidate-selection (next session).
4. **[`docs/v0.6-plan.md`](./docs/v0.6-plan.md)** — shipped M38
   (files-shaped friendly `--set`) with §22 R-class log
   (R-v0.6-NEW-*).
5. **[`docs/v0.5-plan.md`](./docs/v0.5-plan.md)** — shipped M34–M37
   with §22 R-class log (R-v0.5-NEW-*).
6. **[`docs/v0.4-plan.md`](./docs/v0.4-plan.md)** — shipped M29–M33
   with §22 R-class log (R-NEW-72 through R-NEW-84 graduated).
7. **[`docs/v0.3-plan.md`](./docs/v0.3-plan.md)** — shipped M19–M28
   with §22 R-class log (R-NEW-1 through R-NEW-43).
8. **[`docs/v0.2-plan.md`](./docs/v0.2-plan.md)** — shipped M8–M18
   (R20–R53).
9. **[`docs/v0.1-plan.md`](./docs/v0.1-plan.md)** — shipped M0–M7
   foundations.

## Conventions

Full coding standards live in `.claude/rules/` — files auto-load when
editing matching paths:

| File | Loads when editing | Topic |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| `typescript.md` | `src/**`, `tests/**` | TS strictness, no-`any`, no-`null`-by-default |
| `testing.md` | `tests/**` | Coverage standard, test layers, mocking rules |
| `validation.md` | `src/**`, `tests/**` | zod patterns — branded IDs, parse-at-boundary |
| `security.md` | source + `.env*` | Token handling, redaction, fail-secure config |
| `cli.md` | `src/cli/**`, `src/commands/**` | Output discipline, exit codes, signals, stdin |
| `workflow.md` | `src/**`, `tests/**`, `docs/v*-plan.md` | Pre-flight / IMPL / Codex / release-prep disciplines |
| `monday-api.md` | `src/api/**`, `src/commands/**`, `scripts/probe/**` | Endpoint, auth, version pin, SDK drift, pagination |

Headlines (full detail in the rule files):

- **Strictest TypeScript.** No `any` (lint enforced). Avoid `null`
  unless distinct from `undefined`.
- **Tests cover every branch.** Coverage floor 95 / 95.45 / 95 / 95
  (stmts / branches / fns / lines). Raise it; never lower it without
  an inline `vitest.config.ts` rationale.
- **Mock at the network boundary** (stub `fetch`/`undici` or SDK
  `request`), never `commands/*` helpers.
- **ESM with `.js` import specifiers** (NodeNext requirement).
- **One subcommand per file** in `src/commands/`, exported as
  `CommandModule`, registered in `cli/index.ts`.

## Contract headlines

Binding rules most likely to bite if forgotten. Full reasoning and
per-subsystem detail live in [`docs/cli-design.md`](./docs/cli-design.md)
at the linked section. **Don't restate per-subsystem detail here.**

- **Primary user is AI agents; humans are second-class.** When they
  conflict, agent ergonomics win. (§1)
- **Output:** table on TTY, JSON when piped; `--json` is the explicit
  alias. Tables truncate; JSON never does. (§3.1, §3.2)
- **Universal envelope** on every command. Success
  `{ok, data, meta, warnings}`; failure `{ok: false, error, meta}`.
  `meta` always carries `schema_version`, `api_version`, `request_id`,
  `source: "live"|"cache"|"mixed"|"none"`, `cache_age_seconds`,
  `retrieved_at`. Adding fields is non-breaking; removing/renaming is
  major. (§6.1)
- **29 stable error codes.** Errors carry `code`, `message`,
  `http_status`, `monday_code`, `request_id`, `retryable`,
  `retry_after_seconds`. Agents key off `code`, never English.
  Full list + `details.reason` discriminators in §6.5.
- **Exit codes:** 0 success, 1 usage / `confirmation_required`,
  2 API/network, 3 config, 130 SIGINT.
- **No interactive prompts ever.** Destructive ops without `--yes`
  return `confirmation_required`. (§3.1)
- **Two-level command depth** (`monday <noun> <verb>`); two carve-outs
  at three levels — `dev` namespace and `item time-track <verb>`.
  (§5.2)
- **Cursor pagination expires at 60 min — fail fast with
  `stale_cursor`, never silently re-issue.** (§5.6)
- **Column-value abstraction** is what makes `--set` work. Writable
  allowlist + `--set-raw <col>=<json>` escape hatch for
  `change_column_value`-shaped types. Friendly translator routes
  unsupported types to `unsupported_column_type` with hints. (§5.3)
- **`board describe` ships `example_set` per writable column** so an
  agent can construct `--set` calls from one read.

## Workflow rules

The milestone-specific disciplines (cross-doc greps, candidate-
selection, pre-flight stubs, Codex skip-conditions, release-prep
deferral slip) auto-load via `.claude/rules/workflow.md` when editing
`src/**`, `tests/**`, or `docs/v*-plan.md`. Always-on rules:

- **Auto-test:** `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` after
  any change. Failing gates block.
- **Auto-document:** new commands → update `docs/cli-design.md` §4.3
  + any contract changes. Update *this file's* "Contract headlines"
  only if a binding decision moved.
- **Two-AI review** for non-trivial design + per-milestone IMPL —
  Codex (gpt-5.5). See `workflow.md` for the invocation + skip rules.
- **Atomic, incremental commits.** One self-contained unit each.
  Messages explain WHY and HOW, not WHAT. Conventional Commits +
  SemVer. CI gates everything on Node 22 + 24; don't merge red.

## Monday API quick pointer

Endpoint `POST https://api.monday.com/v2`; auth via `Authorization:
<token>` header (no `Bearer ` prefix); API version pinned `2026-01`.

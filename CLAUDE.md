# CLAUDE.md

> [AGENTS.md](https://agents.md/) format — context for AI coding agents.

## Project overview

`monday-cli` is a TypeScript CLI for Monday.com's GraphQL API.
**Primary audience is AI coding agents** (Claude Code, Codex, etc.);
humans are second-class. Built incrementally via Claude Code on top of
`@mondaydotcomorg/api` (pinned to 14.0.0; Monday API pinned `2026-01`).

## Status

**v0.3-M21 closed.** v0.2.0 published to npm 2026-05-08. v0.3 is
in progress on `main`; M0–M20 + M21 closed. **M22 unblocked.**

Per-milestone narratives, post-mortems, and R-class history live
in the plan docs — **do not duplicate them here**:
- `docs/v0.3-plan.md` §11 M19, §12 M20, §13 M21 post-mortems +
  §22 R-class backlog (R-NEW-1 shipped + R-NEW-2 / R-NEW-3
  candidates open + R-watch-items).
- `docs/v0.2-plan.md` §3 + §X post-mortems for M8–M18 + §22 for
  R20–R53.
- `docs/v0.1-plan.md` for M0–M7 + M2.5 refactor pass.

**Live numbers (post-M21 coverage-push close):**
- Test count: **2609** across 114 files (was 2602 at M21 close;
  +7 net in the coverage-push: 2 emit.ts mutation-slot tests +
  1 buildProgram default-cliDescription test + 2 oauth.ts
  default-args tests + 1 readCredentials EISDIR-via-dir-at-path
  test + 1 profile-resolution global-flag-wins test).
- Coverage: **99.11 / 95.56 / 99.36 / 99.26** (stmts / branches /
  fns / lines), above the **95 / 95.45 / 95 / 95** floor. The
  post-M21 coverage push recovered the 95.45 branches floor
  (94.5 → 95.45) by writing the seven targeted tests above and
  folding ten broken multi-line `c8 ignore` directives into the
  two-line form so v8 honours them. Margin against the new floor
  is **0.11pp**.
- ERROR_CODES count: **29** (`oauth_failed` joined at M21
  pre-flight). Command count: **74** (auth login/logout joined
  at M21 pre-flight).
- Floor never lowered without an inline `vitest.config.ts`
  rationale comment.

**Pre-publish blocker (carried to v0.3.0 release prep):**
`OAUTH_CLIENT_ID` + `OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET` placeholders in
`src/api/oauth.ts` ship as `<UNREGISTERED_PENDING_OAUTH_APP>`.
One-time external step: register a Monday OAuth app at
https://developer.monday.com/apps with redirect URI exactly
`http://127.0.0.1:9876/callback`, then swap the constants. Until
then production users hit `oauth_failed.code_exchange_failed`.
Tests don't depend on the values (cassettes intercept
`/oauth2/token`). Pinned in source per the public-OAuth-client
convention.

**Next session — likely scope:**
1. **M22 pre-flight contract diff** (mirrors the `5c07840` /
   `d822982` / `a702af2` cadence). New modules
   `src/api/probes.ts` + `src/api/usage.ts`; new commands
   `monday status` + `monday usage`; close M22-specific
   decisions (7 + 8) per `docs/v0.3-plan.md` §3 M22 + §8.
2. Pre-flight starts with an empirical probe per §22
   R-watch-item — the `account.complexity` surface for
   `monday usage` + the status-probe wire shape for
   `monday status` need verification against `2026-01` before
   stub bodies land.

**R-class state (post-M21 coverage-push close)** (full
detail in `docs/v0.3-plan.md` §22):
- **Shipped:** R-NEW-1 `isENOENT` lift into `src/utils/fs.ts`
  (`1c77699`, M21 close).
- **Open candidates:** R-NEW-2 `credentialsHomeOptions` (fires
  at `monday auth status`, v0.3.x — the helper now carries a
  `c8 ignore` on its HOME-undefined branch in both login.ts +
  logout.ts that the lift can clean up at the lift point);
  R-NEW-3 `wrapFsError` factory (may fire at M22 if
  `monday status` adds a third named wrap site).
- **R-watch-items:** `vi.stubGlobal('fetch')` boundary mock
  pattern (single-consumer; second at M22 status probes);
  Post-OAuth fresh-transport pattern (single-consumer; ratified
  by Codex M21 P1); `c8 ignore` vs v8 branch-coverage friction
  (tooling — recovered at `7058754` without provider switch;
  watch-item stays open for the next floor cycle, but the
  recovery established `c8 ignore start/stop` block-wraps as
  the project default per testing.md); **filesystem-state
  probes** for non-ENOENT fs-error branches (test-pattern;
  EISDIR-via-dir-at-path probe ratified at `7058754`).

## Pre-flight contract diff discipline

Every milestone whose pre-flight contract surface introduces new
modules / commands / ERROR_CODES / cli-design sections runs
through:

1. **Empirical probe** for any novel API surface (§22
   R-watch-item — fired first at M21 OAuth, scripts under
   `scripts/probe/` reuses `_lib.ts`).
2. **Pre-flight contract diff commit** lands module signatures
   (stub bodies under `c8 ignore`) + ERROR_CODES widening +
   cli-design extension + cross-doc count bumps + the
   milestone-specific decisions list.
3. **Codex pre-flight review** (1-2 rounds) before any feat
   commit.
4. **Implementation commits** swap stubs for runtime bodies; new
   contract widenings are surface-only.
5. **Codex implementation review** (1-2 rounds) before declaring
   done.
6. **Close-docs sweep** (post-mortem in `v0.3-plan.md` §X +
   `§9` preconditions tick + `§22` R-class log + cli-design SHA
   backfills + this file's status flip).

This document is for the **current live state + non-obvious
discipline pointers**. For shipped milestone detail, read the
plan-doc post-mortems.

The three binding documents — read in this order before writing code:

1. **[`docs/cli-design.md`](./docs/cli-design.md)** — canonical
   contract: command surface, output envelope, 29 stable error codes,
   deferral list, every binding decision. Changes land via PRs that
   argue for the change, not by drift.
2. **[`docs/v0.3-plan.md`](./docs/v0.3-plan.md)** — active plan:
   milestones M19–M28 with deliverables, exit criteria, decisions log,
   per-milestone post-mortems land at milestone close.
3. **[`docs/v0.2-plan.md`](./docs/v0.2-plan.md)** — shipped foundations
   M8–M18 with per-milestone post-mortems (M8/M9/M10/M11/M12 +
   M13–M18 + R-class refactor backlogs R20–R53). Reference for
   patterns v0.3 milestones build on.
4. **[`docs/v0.1-plan.md`](./docs/v0.1-plan.md)** — shipped foundations
   M0–M7 with M2.5 refactor pass and the M5a/M5b split. Reference for
   the foundational patterns every later milestone builds on.

Supplementary: [`docs/output-shapes.md`](./docs/output-shapes.md)
(snapshot-backed per-command `data` reference);
[`docs/architecture.md`](./docs/architecture.md) (internal module
structure); [`docs/api-reference.md`](./docs/api-reference.md) (Monday
concepts cheat sheet — *not* contract).

## Commands

```bash
npm install
npm run dev -- <args>          # tsx-based dev runner (no build step)
npm run build && npm start -- <args>

# Quality gates — run all three before committing
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test                       # add :unit / :integration / :e2e / :coverage / :watch as needed
```

## Directory layout

```
src/
  cli/         # Commander entry, runner, signal/abort plumbing
  commands/    # One file per CLI subcommand (thin — delegates to api/)
  api/         # Monday API wrapper around @mondaydotcomorg/api
  config/      # Env/file config + zod validation
  types/       # Shared types (incl. branded IDs)
  utils/       # Logger, output formatters, error helpers, redaction
tests/         # unit / integration / e2e / fixtures
docs/          # see "Status"; cli-design.md is the contract
.claude/rules/ # path-scoped agent rules — see "Conventions"
```

## Conventions

The full coding standard lives in `.claude/rules/` — files auto-load
when editing matching paths:

| File | Loads when editing | Topic |
|------|--------------------|-------|
| `typescript.md` | `src/**`, `tests/**` | TS strictness, no-`any`, no-`null`-by-default |
| `testing.md` | `tests/**` | Coverage standard, test layers, mocking rules |
| `validation.md` | `src/**`, `tests/**` | zod patterns — branded IDs, parse-at-boundary |
| `security.md` | source + `.env*` | Token handling, redaction, fail-secure config |
| `cli.md` | `src/cli/**`, `src/commands/**` | Output discipline, exit codes, signals, stdin |

Headlines (full detail in the rule files):

- **Strictest TypeScript settings.** No `any` (lint enforced). Avoid
  `null` unless distinct from `undefined`.
- **Tests cover every branch.** Coverage floor 95% / 95% / 95% / 94%
  (lines / fns / stmts / branches). Raise it; never lower it.
- **Mock at the network boundary** (stub `fetch`/`undici` or SDK
  `request`), never `commands/*` helpers.
- **ESM with `.js` import specifiers** (NodeNext requirement).
- **One subcommand per file** in `src/commands/`, exported as
  `CommandModule`, registered in `cli/index.ts`.

## Contract headlines

These are the binding rules most likely to bite if forgotten. Full
reasoning (and per-subsystem implementation detail) lives in
`docs/cli-design.md` at the linked section.

- **Primary user is AI agents; humans are second-class** — when they
  conflict, agent ergonomics win. (§1)
- **Output:** table on TTY, JSON when piped; `--json` is the explicit
  alias. Tables truncate; JSON never does. (§3.1, §3.2)
- **Universal envelope** on every command. Success
  `{ok, data, meta, warnings}`; failure `{ok: false, error, meta}`.
  `meta` always carries `schema_version`, `api_version`, `request_id`,
  `source: "live"|"cache"|"mixed"|"none"`, `cache_age_seconds`,
  `retrieved_at`. Adding fields is non-breaking; removing/renaming is
  major. (§6.1)
- **29 stable error codes** (`usage_error` / `not_found` /
  `ambiguous_column` / `ambiguous_match` / `column_archived` /
  `unsupported_column_type` / `rate_limited` / `complexity_exceeded` /
  `stale_cursor` / `tag_not_found` / `oauth_failed` / etc. —
  `ambiguous_match` joined the registry at M12; `tag_not_found`
  joined as a v0.3-M19 prerequisite ahead of the `tags` friendly
  translator; `oauth_failed` joined at the v0.3-M21 pre-flight
  contract diff as the `monday auth login` umbrella per cli-design
  §7.3.3, with `details.reason` discriminating per failure mode).
  Errors carry `code`, `message`, `http_status`, `monday_code`,
  `request_id`, `retryable`, `retry_after_seconds`. Agents key off
  `code`, never English. (§6.5)
- **Exit codes:** 0 success, 1 usage / `confirmation_required`,
  2 API/network, 3 config, 130 SIGINT.
- **No interactive prompts ever.** Destructive ops without `--yes`
  return `confirmation_required`. (§3.1)
- **Two-level command depth** (`monday <noun> <verb>`); two carve-outs
  at three levels — `dev` namespace (workflow shortcuts; carve-out 1)
  and `item time-track <verb>` (verb-shaped column-type extensions;
  carve-out 2). (§5.2)
- **Cursor pagination expires at 60 min — fail fast with
  `stale_cursor`, never silently re-issue.** (§5.6)
- **Column-value abstraction** is what makes `--set` work. Writable
  allowlist after M8: `text`, `long_text`, `numbers`, `status`,
  `dropdown`, `date`, `people`, `link`, `email`, `phone`. Other types
  → `unsupported_column_type` with category-specific hints; the
  `--set-raw <col>=<json>` escape hatch covers `change_column_value`-
  shaped types (M8). (§5.3)
- **`board describe` ships `example_set` per writable column** so an
  agent can construct `--set` calls from one read. (M3 exit criterion)

For per-subsystem detail (column-types module, dry-run engine, item
create/move/archive/delete/duplicate semantics, resolver-warning fold,
mutation envelope shape, pagination walkers, filter DSL, etc.) read the
relevant cli-design.md section and the milestone post-mortems in
v0.1-plan.md / v0.2-plan.md. **Don't restate them here.**

## Workflow rules

- **Auto-test:** `npm run typecheck && npm run lint && npm test` after
  any change. Failing gates block.
- **Auto-document:** new commands → update `docs/cli-design.md` §4.3
  + any contract changes. Update *this file's* "Contract headlines"
  only if a binding decision moved.
- **Two-AI review** for non-trivial design decisions AND per-milestone
  implementation passes. Codex (gpt-5.5) via
  `codex exec -m gpt-5.5 -s read-only - < .review-prompt.md > .review-output.md`
  (`.review-*.md` is gitignored). Two triggers:
  - Design changes to `docs/cli-design.md` or `docs/v0.x-plan.md` →
    reviewed before merge.
  - Implementation milestones → reviewed before declaring done. The M0
    review caught 10 bugs (token leak, broken SIGINT, schema/commander
    drift); skipping costs more than the Codex run. Ask before adding
    new AI collaborators.
- **Atomic, incremental commits.** One self-contained unit per commit:
  small enough to revert cleanly, large enough to stand alone. Never
  commit broken `main`.
- **Commit messages explain WHY and HOW, not WHAT.** Diff shows what.
  Spend the message on motivation and approach. Bare conventional-commit
  subject is fine when there's no meaningful why/how — better short than
  padded with "added X, removed Y" prose.
- **Conventional Commits + SemVer.** `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` /
  `refactor:` / `test:` / `chore:`. Major bump for breaking
  output/exit-code changes; minor for new commands; patch for fixes.
- **CI gates everything** on Node 22 + 24
  (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`). Don't merge red.

## Monday API notes

Full picture in `cli-design.md` §2. Headlines:

- **Endpoint:** `POST https://api.monday.com/v2`.
- **Auth:** `Authorization: <token>` (no `Bearer ` prefix). Loaded from
  `MONDAY_API_TOKEN` env or `.env`.
- **API version pinned `2026-01`** (`API-Version` header on every
  request); matches SDK 14.0.0's `CURRENT_VERSION`. Override with
  `--api-version` or `MONDAY_API_VERSION`. Bumping the pin requires
  bumping the SDK and is a SemVer-minor (major if output schema
  changes).
- **SDK ↔ API drift.** SDK 14.0.0 types `2026-01` but doesn't expose
  some fields (`BatteryValue`, `hierarchy_type`, `is_leaf`,
  `capabilities`) — those need raw GraphQL via `client.request<T>()`.
  See `cli-design.md` §2.8 / §2.9.
- **Boundary-typing trap.** SDK exports
  `QueryVariables = Record<string, any>`. The `src/api/` wrapper must
  keep `any` from leaking into `commands/*` — internal code sees
  `Record<string, unknown>` (or named GraphQL input types).
- **Pagination:** `items_page(limit ≤500, cursor)` →
  `next_items_page(cursor)`; 60-min cursor lifetime. Flat `items`
  query is deprecated.
- **Rate limits + error codes** mapped to CLI `error.code` per
  `cli-design.md` §2.5 / §6.5.

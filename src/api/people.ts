/**
 * Pure people-resolution helpers for the `people` column-value
 * translator (`cli-design.md` §5.3 step 3, the people grammar
 * line 728-734 + the `me` token rule line 704-707).
 *
 * Surface:
 *
 *   - `parsePeopleInput` — accepts the comma-split email list +
 *     `me` token sugar `cli-design.md` §5.3 step 3 enumerates and
 *     returns the Monday wire payload (`{personsAndTeams: [...]}`).
 *     Async because email→ID resolution can hit the network; the
 *     caller injects a `PeopleResolutionContext` carrying
 *     `resolveMe` + `resolveEmail` callbacks so this module stays
 *     pure (no `client` imports — same inversion `filters.ts` uses
 *     for its `me` plumbing).
 *
 * **Why a separate module.** column-values.ts owns translator
 * *dispatch* — the switch over WritableColumnType, the
 * mutation-selection helper, and the ApiError builder. The people
 * translator's machinery is a small async function with regex
 * shape-checks + token classification + safe-integer conversion;
 * splitting keeps column-values.ts at one screen of dispatch logic
 * and the people-specific concerns isolated for unit testing —
 * same template `dates.ts` followed in the previous M5a session.
 *
 * **Why the `me` callback shape mirrors filters.ts.** `filters.ts`
 * already takes `resolveMe: () => Promise<string>` for its `me`
 * sugar on people-style columns. M5b's command layer plumbs the
 * same callback through both surfaces — agents learning one `me`
 * rule for read filters don't need to learn a different one for
 * `--set`. A second callback (`resolveEmail`) handles the email
 * branch; M5b will wire it to `resolvers.userByEmail` (which owns
 * the directory cache + `users(emails:)` fallback).
 *
 * **No `kind: 'team'` support in v0.1.** cli-design.md §5.3 step 3
 * line 730 prescribes `{id, kind: 'person'}` only. Monday's API
 * accepts `kind: 'team'` for team assignments but the design
 * defers teams to a v0.2 candidate. Logged as a spec gap in
 * v0.1-plan.md §3 M5a.
 *
 * **Numeric tokens rejected.** cli-design.md §5.3 step 3 only
 * lists emails + `me`. Numeric tokens (`--set Owner=12345`) are
 * rejected with a `usage_error` pointing at `--set-raw '{
 * "personsAndTeams": [{"id": 12345, "kind": "person"}]}'` so
 * agents that already have a user ID can paste-and-edit. cli-
 * design doesn't say either way; logged as a spec gap.
 *
 * **Shared seams.** `isMeToken` lives in `src/api/me-token.ts`
 * (R15) — same helper backs `--where Owner=me` (filters.ts) and
 * `item search --where Owner=me` (commands/item/search.ts).
 * `DECIMAL_USER_ID_PATTERN` lives in `src/types/ids.ts` (R16) —
 * same regex backs the resolver-side `userDirectoryEntrySchema`
 * brand in resolvers.ts. Both lifts replaced verbatim copies that
 * had drifted independently across the people-session Codex
 * passes; consolidating the source of truth prevents the next
 * drift outright.
